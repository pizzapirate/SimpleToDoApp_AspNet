# My Simple To Do App
This is a simple To Do web app I made using ASP.NET as the web framework for learning purposes as well as a Mongo Atlas cloud-based database hosted on Amazon's AWS service. 
The app is fully functional and registered users can begin creating a personal list of tasks in the database that they would like to complete.
Full documentation and privacy is available on the site.
